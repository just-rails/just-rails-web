# just-rails-web

A website for intermediate Ruby on Rails users to compare programming practices, review gems, and otherwise talk shop.

### Why?

Nowadays, most of the information available about Ruby on Rails on the web is aimed at beginners, and most of it is in the form of blog posts and articles. The former creates an undue focus in the community on beginner-level concepts, and the latter encourages a combative and sensational style of writing.

The combined effect of this is what I call "Rails: The Good Parts" - an
environment where the loudest voices are the ones
which most convincingly oppose conventional wisdom on topics popular among
Rails novices.

### What?

The goal is to start a community that is free, cooperative, and focused on one
thing: pushing the Rails framework to the limits to create exceptional web
apps.

### How?

* No casual visitors -- free registration required.
* Anonymity is encouraged.
* Directed content formats -- no soapboxes.

### Content

* User experience reports
