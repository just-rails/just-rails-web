# just-rails-web

A website for intermediate Ruby on Rails users to compare programming practices, review gems and plugins, and otherwise talk shop in a non-judgmental and link-bait-free way.

### Why?

I created this website to fill a perceived need in the community for **free content and discussion** geared towards **intermediate users of Rails**. 

Most of the information available about Ruby on Rails on the web is in the form of blog posts and articles, which is a format that encourages a highly opinionated and combative style of writing. Many developers aren't necessarily interested in hearing about the One True Way to write Rails applications, but only want friendly dialogue about tools and techniques. This website aims to cater those developers.

### How?

#### No casual visitors

User-submitted content is not available to casual visitors. All readers are required to register on the site for free. This is to discourage link-bait articles that are overly pushy or critical for the purpose of attracting casual one-time readers.

#### Anonymity encouraged

All users have the option of submitting content in total anonymity. This is to encourage people to talk openly about tools and techniques they have used on the job, without fear of repercussions by their company.

It also prevents the appearance of name-brand celebrities on the site, who might domineer the discussions in one way or another.

#### Focused content formats

There is no general blog feature which people can use as a soapbox to say anything they want. All content submission is done via specialized input forms which focus the discussion in a specific technical direction.

### Types of content

#### Experience reports

This allows developers to share stories of real-world Rails applications with one another. What type of application was it? What was the product domain? How large was it? What challenges did you face? What were your solutions? How did those solutions turn out? What would you do differently next time? Other users also have a chance to question the original poster and discuss his experience with him.

#### Gem reviews

Users can submit reviews of gems, where the gems are rated on many different aspects: concept, generality, stablity, integration cost, maintenance cost, etc. Gem authors can also post new gems and request reviews from other users.
