# just-rails-web

A website for intermediate Ruby on Rails users to compare programming practices, review gems and plugins, and otherwise talk shop in a non-combative and link-bait-free way.

### Why?

Nowadays, most of the information available about Ruby on Rails on the web is aimed at beginners, and most of it is in the form of blog posts and articles. These formats encourage a highly opinionated and combative style of writing. Although this style is exciting for novices and makes for great link bait, it can be tiresome for experienced devs who just want friendly dialogue about tools and techniques.

The goal is to start a community that is free, cooperative, and focused on one
thing: developing great Rails apps.
